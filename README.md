# About me

*Once upon a time, I found joy and excitement in technology then had my career life change when going from a Software Development Intern/Junior to DevOps Specialist*. Now I study in the DevOps field building a platform for engineers while searching for a full-time IT-Software Developement Engineer position.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on different things, where I am working as a software engineer for myself and clients creating production grade end to end projects.
- ðŸŒ± I have worked as an Intern at biomedical engineering organizations while studying and later transitioned into the DevOps field. I have also worked as a DevOps Specialist where I did automation, implementation and integrations based projects. 
- ðŸ™‡ I recently came across an opportunity to build my very own startup, to have a seamless streamline of data with the help of automation and integration tooling.
