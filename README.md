## About me

There was once a young boy named Luis that was interested in building the future with the help of technology, his career life changed from one Software Developer Junior/Intern to DevOps. Once upon a time, at an early age, my main interests were cars, network security, installing games on a custom built desktop, 
insatlling mods on said games, figuring out CLIs and GUIs and iPods! Fast forward< I fell in love with computational data, math, and a little bit of physics! All of that has led me to study Computer Science Engineering with Math and in hopes to earn my Masters!!
