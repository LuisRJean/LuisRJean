# About me

*There was once a young boy named Luis that was interested in building the future with the help of technology, his career life changed from one Software Developer Junior/Intern to DevOps Specialist*. Now I work and study in the DevOps field and I am honored and grateful with this choice to be in this position to make an impact. *Once upon a time, at an early age, my main interests were cars, network security, installing games on a custom built desktop, 
installing mods on said games, figuring out CLIs with GUIs and iPods!* Fast forward < I fell in love with computational data, math, and a little bit of physics! All of that has led me to study Computer Science Engineering with Math to earn my Masters!! In hopes to make myself a full IT-Dev-SecOps Engineer.
