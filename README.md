# About me

*There was once a young boy named Luis that was interested in supporting the future with the help of technology, his career life changed from a Software Developer Intern/Junior to DevOps Specialist*. Now I study in the DevOps field in hopes of building a platform for developers while in hopes of coming across a full time IT-Software Developement Engineer position!
