# About me

*Once upon a time, young boy named Luis that was interested in supporting the future with the help of technology, his career life changed from a Software Developer Intern/Junior to DevOps Specialist*. Now I study in the DevOps field building a platform for engineers while in search of a full time IT-Software Developement Engineer position.


## Hola, I’m Luis Jean 👋
### A passionate Developer
- 🔭 I am currently working on different things, where I am working as a software engineer for myself and clients creating production grade end to end projects.
- 🌱 I have worked as an Intern at biomedical engineering organizations while studying and later transitioned into the DevOps field. I have also worked as a DevOps Specialist where I did automation and integrations based projects. 
- 🙇 I recently came across a golden opportunity to build a my own startup, to have a seamless streamline of data with the help of automation and integration tooling.
